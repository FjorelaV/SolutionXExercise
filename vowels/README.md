# Vowels

## The Problem

Consisting of English vowels only, and each of the 5 English vowels (a,e,i,o,u) must appear at least once in it.
The letters must be sorted in alphabeltical order ie. a before e and e before i

## Example

```js
Example: strings 'aeiou' and 'aaaaaaaeiiiioou' are okay
but 'uaeio', 'aaaaeeeooo' are not good

Given a string consisting of English Characters and Numbers, return the length of the longest beautiful substrings in the given string. If no such substring exists return 0.
A substring is a continious sequence of characters in a string.

'abcdeaeiaaioaaaaeiiiiouuuooaauuaeiu' => output : 13
```
